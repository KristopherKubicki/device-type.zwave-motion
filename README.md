# SmartThings Z-wave Motion Sensor with Refresh

This device is a standard SmartThings Z-Wave motion device with the added refresh capability for stale motion reaping.  Hitting "refresh" on the device will set the motion detection from "active" to "inactive", which basically gives your apps an override on any motion detection. 

It's mostly useful when paired with some kind of automated process that will hit refresh for you.
